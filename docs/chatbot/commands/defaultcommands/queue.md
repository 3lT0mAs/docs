The `!queue` command is used to manage the viewer queue during live streams. It has several subcommands:

- `pick username`: This subcommand is used to manually pick a viewer from the queue.
- `pick random`: This subcommand is used to randomly pick a viewer from the queue.
- `remove username`: This subcommand is used to remove a viewer from the queue.
- `list`: This subcommand is used to display a full list of the queue.
- `position`: This subcommand is used to display a viewer's position in the queue.
- `close`: This subcommand is used to close the queue.
- `pause`: This subcommand is used to stop viewers from entering the queue.
- `unpause`: This subcommand is used to re-open the queue.

Each subcommand should be used as `!queue <subcommand>`.
