# Custom Bot

If you want to use a name separate from the default StreamElements bot account, you can connect a different account for messages to be sent from in the bot settings. 

## Connecting an account

1. Go to the [bot settings](https://streamelements.com/dashboard/bot/settings) page.
2. Click the `Connect with Twitch` button in the custom bot name section.
3. Authorize the bot account you want to use.
    - If you are logged in on an account you don't want to use, click "not you? log out" at the top near avatar.

### What's changed?

Previously, in order to use the custom bot name feature it was required to install SE.Live. This is no longer the case, and you can use the custom bot name feature without installing SE.Live and the custom name will always be used, regardless of if SE.Live is open or not.
